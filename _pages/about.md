Welcome to my academic journey! I am Mohammad Mahmudul Hasan, a passionate researcher and educator in the field of Information and Communication Technology. Currently, I am pursuing my Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Norway, where I am deeply immersed in cutting-edge research on wireless communication systems, microwave sensors, and advanced signal processing techniques. My work focuses on developing innovative solutions for real-world challenges, particularly in the areas of antenna design, gas sensing, and secure communication systems.

Academic Journey
======
My academic journey began at KIIT University in India, where I earned both my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering. During my time at KIIT, I was honored with the Chancellor’s Gold Medal for achieving the highest CGPA and the Founder’s Gold Medal for securing the first position in my Master’s program. These accolades fueled my passion for research and set the foundation for my future endeavors.

I have had the privilege of expanding my horizons through international collaborations and research experiences. As a Visiting Researcher at Brno University of Technology in the Czech Republic, I delved into the fascinating world of Design and Process Engineering, further enriching my expertise in automation and sensor technologies. My research has led to the publication of numerous papers in prestigious journals such as IEEE Sensors Journal, ACS Sensors, and IEEE Access, where I explore topics ranging from molecularly imprinted polymer-based sensors to adaptive antenna impedance matching and physical-layer security in MIMO-OFDM systems.

In addition to my research, I have a strong commitment to education and mentorship. I have served as an Assistant Professor and Head of the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering at the University of Information Technology and Science in Bangladesh. During my tenure, I also took on roles as the Director of the Information and Communication Technology Cell and as an Editorial Board Member for the Journal of Science and Engineering. These experiences have allowed me to contribute to the academic community while nurturing the next generation of engineers and researchers.

My professional journey has been further enriched by industrial training and internships at organizations such as Sanyo Engineering & Construction in Japan, GrameenPhone Ltd. in Bangladesh, and All India Radio & Doordarshan in India. These experiences have provided me with a practical understanding of the telecommunications industry and have shaped my approach to solving complex engineering problems.

I am fluent in Bengali, English, and Hindi, and I am currently learning Norwegian (Norsk-Bokmål) to better connect with the vibrant academic and cultural community in Norway. When I am not immersed in research or teaching, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and engaging in interdisciplinary collaborations that push the boundaries of innovation.

I am deeply grateful for the guidance and support of my PhD supervisor, Dr. Michael Cheffena Gebresilassie, and my co-supervisor, Dr. Pavel Škrabánek, who have been instrumental in shaping my research journey. Their mentorship has inspired me to strive for excellence and to contribute meaningfully to the field of Information and Communication Technology.

Thank you for visiting my website. I invite you to explore my research, publications, and projects, and I look forward to connecting with fellow researchers, collaborators, and enthusiasts who share a passion for advancing technology and knowledge.

Let’s innovate together!
